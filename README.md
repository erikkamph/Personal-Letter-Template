## Commands
command | # of arguments | argument | comment
--------|----------------|----------|--------
\\service or \\title | 1 | spontan or %title% | spontan meaning "Spontanans√∂kan" and %title% being the title of the job ad
\\createheader | 8 | name, date of birth (yyyy-mm-dd), mail, phone, company contact name, company name, address, zip and city | Order is important, creates the 4 lines seen in the ```Personal_Letter_Template.pdf```
\\spontaneous | 6 | name, mail, phone, company name, address, zip and city | Creates the same as ```createheader```-command but without date of birth and name to contact person on the company
\\bsone | 6 | figure it out by setting each parameter to x to display the text | A paragraph which is used for introduction
\\bstwo | 5 | - | same as \\bsone
\\bsthree | 5 | - | same as \\bsone
\\fsone | 3 | - | A paragraph which is nice to use as ending in the personal letter
\\fstwo | 3 | - | same as \\fsone
\\fsthree | 3 | - | same as \\fsone
\\fragment | 1 | text | create a non-indented paragraph with automatic newline at the end
\\sign | 1 | name | like \\fsone to \\fsthree but without the paragraph before

Where there are a dash instead of a list of arguments follow the instruction on \\bsone for now, as you will have to use your own words in those commands. Where there are arguments just follow the arguments and everything will look nicer.
